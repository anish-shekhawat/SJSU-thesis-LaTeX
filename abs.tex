In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of malware attacks that encrypts its Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic for self-propagation and communication. Due to the increase in worldwide adoption of encryption as a means to secure and maintain the integrity of digital communication, encrypted malicious traffic resembles normal traffic. As the malicious traffic is now encrypted and looks like normal traffic, it poses a new challenge for the anti-virus software and firewalls used to detect malware. Thus, new detection techniques and features that do not need to decrypt the malware traffic is needed. Such a technique will be cheaper, faster and will respect the privacy of the user, as it does not need to decrypt the network traffic for detection. In this survey, we will explore various methods and their limitations to detect encrypted malware traffic.
