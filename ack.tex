I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Mark Stamp, for his encouragement, patience, and continuous guidance throughout my project and graduate studies as well. I would also like thank my committee members Dr. Katerina Potika and Fabio Di Troia for reviewing my work and providing valuable feedback.

I am also grateful to my family and friends who have supported me throughout the course of my Masters program.
